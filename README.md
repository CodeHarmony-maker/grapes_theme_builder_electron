Gramateria v1.0.6 is a re-rewritten version that changed many features and code.

> Although I have stopped developing this app for a while, there are still many users and I feel a little bad because of my old/dirty codes. So I decided to refactor the codes and add some features to be more useful for developers and non-developers in this v1.0.6.


## Installation 

```npm install```

```npm start```

## Development
#### Compile sources

```npm run dev```

```npm run watch```

```npm run prod```


## Build desktop app

```npm run pack```

Check `export` folder after running `npm run pack` command.

- Remove Gapesjs export plugin 
- Remove dashboard version in v1.0.4 which was built with vue.js, element UI and firebase. [reason of removing dashboard](#remove-message)


#### Reason of removing dashboard
<a name="remove-message"></a>
Because making Gramateria to compatible with Vue, ElementUI and Firebase versions is not an easy task for me. And I want to keep Gramateria as a desktop based app.

#### Roadmap
- Add more blocks
- Change icons for section blocks
- Make it available for linux and window. 
- Add more SEO tags
- Build multiple pages 
- Improve UI
